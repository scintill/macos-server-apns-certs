**Deprecation**: See https://github.com/freswa/dovecot-xaps-daemon for a more polished and automated way to manage your mail certificate. It might also be a better starting point for reusable code for generating the other certs.

----

This repository is about getting APNs (Apple Push Notification service) certificates for functions formerly provided by macOS Server, e.g., push notifications from your self-hosted email server to iOS's built-in Mail app. Apple's own certificate generation function became unavailable on modern systems (typically requiring keeping an old VM around), so this project makes it more available and easy-to-use.

# Requirements

* Linux
    * (macOS support won't be too hard, so please open an issue if you'd like it)

# Download and Configure

1. `git clone https://github.com/scintill/macos-server-apns-certs.git` in a convenient folder on Linux.
1. Configure
	* `echo -n yourHostName > config/hostname` (the hostname you give here is displayed in [the certificates portal webpage](https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/))
	* `echo -n yourAppleID@example.com > config/username` (you should probably use an Apple ID you've purchased macOS Server with, but I haven't tried whether they require that)	
	* `openssl dgst -sha256 -binary | xxd -p -c 32 > config/passwdhash # type your Apple ID password, then Ctrl-D Ctrl-D`
		* (There is [no need for an app password](https://github.com/scintill/macos-server-apns-certs/issues/3#issuecomment-691528315) if you have 2FA. Use your normal password.)

# Creating the certificate requests

By "requests" in the plural, I mean for com.apple.calendar, com.apple.mail, etc., on one server. You may only care about mail or something, but we'll get them all.

1. If you've previously generated different certificates using this code:
	* **Copy the certificates and private keys somewhere else(!)**
	* run `make clean` to erase the old data and start clean for the next certificates.

1. Run `make request-body`. You should sanity-check the contents compared to `test/expected/request-body`, just making sure no section is blank.

# Sending your certificate request

```
curl -i --data-binary @request-body -H 'Content-Type: text/x-xml-plist' --user-agent 'Servermgrd%20Plugin/6.0 CFNetwork/811.11 Darwin/16.7.0 (x86_64)' https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/caservice/new -H 'Accept: */*' -H 'Accept-Language: en-us' | tee response
```

A success response starts something like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 100 Continue

```

Your certificates should be in the file `response`. The private keys are in the `keys` directory.

You can view and revoke your certificates at https://identity.apple.com/pushcert/ at the bottom.

# "Makefiles?!"

Yeah, it's kind of horrible, but I think it was a decent way to iteratively build up the pieces of the request data during the development process. I only anticipate needing this once a year, so I might not make a nicer implementation...
